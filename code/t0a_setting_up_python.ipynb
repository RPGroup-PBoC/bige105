    "As is true in human language, there are [hundreds of computer programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages). While each has its own merit, the major languages for scientific computing are C, C++, R, MATLAB, Python, Java, and Fortran. [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com) and [Python](https://www.python.org) are similar in syntax and typically read as if they were written in plain english. This makes both languages a useful tool for teaching but they are also very powerful languages and are **very** actively used in real-life research. MATLAB is proprietary while Python is open source. A benefit of being open source is that anyone can write and release Python packages. For science, there are many wonderful community-driven packages such as [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org), [SciPy](http://www.scipy.org), [scikit-image](http://scikit-image.org), and [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org) just to name a few.

    "There are two dominant versions of Python used for scientific computing, Python 2.7.x and Python 3.5.6. We are at an interesting crossroads between these two versions. The most recent release (Python 3.6.0 as of December 2016) is not backwards compatible with previous versions of Python. While there are still some packages written for Python 2.7 that have not been modified for compatibility with Python 3.6, a large number have transitioned. As this will be the future for scientific computing with Python, we will use Python 3.5.0 for these tutorials."
